# Hi, my name is Filippo!  

Some things about me:

- **I love building** anything (though I'm really into B2C software products).  
- **I have to say sorry between 5-20 times a day** (I tend to joke way too much).
- **I love working with other people** (= I fkn hate working alone).  
- **I love moving fast** (= I fkn hate feeling stuck).  
- **I am very opportunistic**.  
- **I am PG fanboy** (and I find myself reading his essays, weekly)


PD:
**I am looking for a cofounder** (= founding something alone is HARD bro).

## A Brief Timeline of My Life:

My brother taught me how to code (I was 13).

Became obsessed with pygame and built a ton of games.  

#### **2014â€“2015**  
Became obsessed with Arduinos:

- Experimented with building autonomous robots.  

#### **2016**  
Released a game made in Unity to the App Store (I felt like a grown-up doing this).

#### **2017**  
Went to Shenzhen with my best friend to build an iPhone from scratch:  
- [Watch my recap video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phlQ3xntPH4&t=319s)  ( I HAD so MUCH hair ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ #balding #receding hairline). 
- Context: We loved [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQszF2iKhx0) so much we went there ourselves.  

#### **2018**  
Started studying Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.  

#### **2019**  
Began working on more ambitious projects with friends and did some freelancing.  

#### **2019â€“2020**  
Got my first real job at [NanoSens](https://www.nanusens.com/about/) YAYYYY MONEYYYY as a physics simulation analyst.  
I left after a yearâ€”it wasnâ€™t for me.  

#### **2021 (December)**  
Moved to Paris and dropped out of university in my last year to join [Mojo (YC '18)](https://mojo-app.com/).  
Best decision of my life.

Quit Mojo to build my own projects.  

#### **2024 (November)**  
Launched **Kano**, my first consumer app.

#### **2024 (December)**  
Got rejected from YC (lol, solo founder was a bad idea, innit?).  

#### **2025 (January)**  
Realized Kano didnâ€™t excite me anymore and removed it from the App Store.
